# Quantum algorithms

As the name suggests, this repository contains the implementations of various quantum algorithms developed and simulated using Cirq (the quantum computing framework created by Google) and Qiskit (the framework from IBM).

## The state of the art: Cirq
Here, I list the algorithms developed at the moment:

 - Shor's algorithm (Cirq)
 - Grover's Algorithm (Cirq)
 - Discrete time Quantum Walk (Cirq)
 - Pricing options with QAE (Qiskit)
 - Tiq-taq-toe, quantum version of tic-tac-toe (Cirq)
 - Simon's Algorithm (Cirq; Qiskit)
 - Quantum Fourier Transform (Cirq)
 - Inverse Quantum Fourier Transform (Cirq)
 - Quantum Phase Estimation (Cirq; Qiskit)
 - Quantum Teleportation (Cirq; Qiskit)
 - Deutsch-Joza Algorithm (Cirq; Qiskit)
 - Deutsch Algorithm (Cirq; Qiskit)
 - Quantum teleportation (Cirq; Qiskit)
 - Superdense coding (Qiskit)
