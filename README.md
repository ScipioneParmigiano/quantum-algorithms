# Quantum algorithms

As the name suggests, this repository contains the implementations of various quantum algorithms developed and simulated using Cirq, the quantum computing framework created by Google.

## The state of the art
Here, I list the algorithms developed at the moment:

### Advanced algorithms
 - Shor's algorithm
 - Discrete time Quantum Walk
 - Pricing options with QAE
 - Tiq-taq-toe, quantum version of tic-tac-toe

### Basic algorithms
 - Grover's Algorithm
 - Simon's Algorithm
 - Quantum Fourier Transform
 - Inverse Quantum Fourier Transform
 - Quantum Phase Estimation
 - Quantum Teleportation
 - Deutsch-Joza Algorithm
 - Deutsch Algorithm
